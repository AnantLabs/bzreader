#summary The history of changes between the versions of BzReader.
#labels Featured

==1.0.4==

  * Fixed a bug in formatting code which would prevent the generation of the HTML on an article with invalid markup (eg. Jan Garbarek in English Wikipedia).

==1.0.3==

  * Fixed an annoying bug in indexing code which would manifest itself when viewing the topic which was split between the bz2 blocks. The BzReader would not show such a topic. *Please, re-create your fulltext index by deleting the [DumpName].idx folder.*

==1.0.2==

  * Added the possibility to navigate Back and Forward between the topics
  * Fixed a bug in viewing the search results when the selected hit was not from the language the user selected.
  

==1.0.1==

  * Microsoft .NET Framework prerequisite condition added to the installation package.
  * Background searches
  * Automatic searches will not trigger error dialogs anymore. You will need to explicitly start a search by pressing Enter to see the error message, if there is any.
